  “Anarchival cinema” and the powers of the false
  Francisco Trento

  The concept of the a a a a aaaaaa narc hive was firstly created in a moment of struggle with the archival procedures of the work done by and with Senselab during more than a decade. The challenge was how to deal with past events through a non-representational archive of recordings of audio and video, pictures, textiles, texts, software, etc. The a a a a aaaaaa narc hive, as Erin Manning says, is not the recording of a form but "passes through form", it's "not documentation but a feeding form mechanism that needs documentation". How to deal both with the intensity and multiplicity of the archives and their fever – “to run after the archive, even if there's too much of it, right where something in it anarchives itself. It is to have a compulsive, repetitive, and nostalgic desire for the archive, an irrepressible desire to return to the origin, a homesickness, a nostalgia for the return to the most archaic place of absolute commencement” (Derrida, 1995, p. 57). The concept of the archive in the manner developed by Derrida already carries an a a a a aaaaaa narc hive potential that needs to be remodulated. It's supplemental, across platforms and it "carries lures that activate further processes", "techniques for process making engines."1
  	In Heart of a Dog, Laurie Anderson does an a(na)rcheological scavenging from years of images, videos and audio clips of her deceased rat terrier, Lolabelle. It is a non-linear/chronological montage film, a media a a a a aaaaaa narc hive or collage - but any mediatic artifact, we must agree, is already a multimodal a a a a aaaaaa narc hive. The three events that activated her work are the deaths of her mother, dog and very good friend, the NYC site-specific artist Gordon Matta Clark. It is precisely the first piece of artwork - the spectral figure of Lolabelle - that later would be incorporated into the film project. Laurie Anderson’s charcoal drawings entitled Forty-Nine Days in the Bardo, exhibited during her multimedia performance Animal Stories, depicted the transient experience of Lolabelle in the “Bardo”. Tibetan Buddhists believe that, when humans die, they enter the intermediate Bardo state, from which they will be reborn as a human or other creature unless they achieve Nirvana, where they are beyond all states of embodiment (Lee, 2017, p. 38). Bardo can also be translated as a “transitional, in-between or liminal state.” (Ibid., p. 39). Before the dogs' travel to the Bardo, we see the process of her dog becoming blind and dying and scenes like Lolabelle playing piano to an audience in a party just after getting completely blind.

      Before that sensorial reorganization, Lolabelle had a previous shifting as she realized that her gaze-way of walking orientation changed due to the ’discovery' of the world in 360 degrees, when she went to California mountains with Laurie aiming to escape the absolute surveillance of the archive post 9/11. There she saw eagles approaching her as pray. Some minutes before a voice-over monologue opened up a new narrative line that would transverse the entire film. New gaze orientations were activated after 9/11. Like her rat terrier, we learned to look up to the sky waiting for rogue planes and terrorist attacks - one must agree that war zones in non-western civilization are already used to this. Like eagles’ wide angle/super high-resolution vision, every place has a surveillance camera, an issue already exhaustively discussed by scholars. Laurie Anderson’s movie aims not only to speculate on what happened, but also what could have happened through what we call fabulatory techniques. She put Go-Pro cameras in other rat terriers after Lolabelle’s death and cellphone videos of those dogs, physically similar to Lolabelle. We do not know which one is Lolabelle. It is part of the fabulatory power of the false. “When Deleuze says we must invent our own intercessors, what he also means is that we are never wholly ourselves” (Manning, 2017, apud Bordeleau; Pape; Rose-Antoniette, 2017, p. 15), especially when confronting otherness. Anderson a a a a aaaaaa narc hives Lolabelle’s recorded video/audio/picture memories creating a narrative that moves through traces, spectres of fear, traumas (9/11) and mourning. Alanna Thain discusses the potential of the fabulation, via Deleuze’s Cinema 2 book:
  Deleuze realizes that there is no need to “blow up” representation, because it has already failed. What we need now are reasons to believe in the world. Flaxman cites Cinema 2 to explain how the powers of the false affirm the generative force of creativity itself: “Affirmation is itself a creative act: ‘to believe is to affirm the powers of fabulation, for only when we affirm the power to ‘make-false’ (faire-faux) do we surpass the true and the false and undertake the whole transformation of belief” (Thain, 2017, p. 33)

  (A brief Spinozist parenthesis

      Unfair as it seems - to take one proposition from the web of concepts and the geometrical thought developed in Ethics, we would like to quote the following statement made by the philosopher: “By the very fact that we conceive a thing, which is like ourselves, and which we have not regarded with any emotion, to be affected with any emotion, we are ourselves affected with a like emotion (affectus)” (Spinoza, Ethics, Part III, Prop. XXVII). Spinoza's semiotic of affects is certainly a very powerful framework to understand the contemporary range of affects that relies on the ontopower regime of distribution of affects and prehensions (including pre-emptive alerts), but we fell that there is something missing; people are missing, and neurodiverse chains of affects may not correspond to its ingenious constitution. Neurodiverse bodies need tiny decolonized ontologies, just like the non-human bodies that can leave the door open to the entrance of the schizz, or in another words, the creative cut. Those bodyminds (or bodyings) usually do not produce the expected outcomes that conform to a specific politics of distribution of bodies and their reactions captured by external evaluative gaze, at least not in a linear fashion. We do not aim to make Spinoza neurodiverse, but to let fabulation enter into the concatenation of affects - imagination and its potential is a very present theme in Spinoza’s ontological system, made explicit at least two hundred times across Ethics, but maybe we’re too used to another Spinoza (and there are many and multiple Spinozas). We do not aim to enter into this realm intensively, just to point out the necessity of tiny systems that can respond to the power of the false, or the potential of speculation (contra the power of the pre-emptive fear). WE MADE PEACE WITH INADEQUATE IDEAS.
   end of ( )

      Lolabelle’s new optical orientation is constrained by ubiquitous surveillance, grief and fear, but to affirm that can look like  a tricky attempt to reinforce human politics into with animal bodies. Laurie Anderson exposes the materiality of archives, before and post 9/11, commenting on gigantic structures that store data collected via surveillance systems in cities’ outskirts, sometimes under the ground, protected from extreme weather conditions. Another example of a kind of a physical data centre that could be part of Laurie’s film, although with notably different purposes, is the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, located in the Svalbard Archipelago (Norway) in the North Arctic 1300 kilometres from the North Pole - if I am blessed by the gods of funding and airfares, a second phase of this project (2019-2020) will involve both a film and a fabulatory fiction that takes place if not in Svalbard, through Svalbard's wandering ghosts of a future not-yet actualized but already dispatching sensorial packages addressed to this actual multiverse. The Svalbard Global Seed Vault is an archive ready to be anarchived after the process of mass extinction caused by climate change and other effects that may arise from the Anthropocene.
  The Svalbard Global Seed Vault, located in Spitzbergen, Norway, is a meta-archive of the roughly 200 global seed banks. It stores seeds from all plants currently available in a nuclear-safe vault. The Svalbard Vault was built in view of the possible scenario of rebuilding the world food supply after some kind of civilization-ending catastrophic event. Until that time, the seeds are not be touched or used. Along similar lines, one could think of an archive as a storage device for cultural meaning in view of post-apocalyptic reconstruction efforts. While some archives tend to develop policies that go in this direction and strongly curtail the circulation of films, archives can also be seen as resources for contemporary cultural production. (Campinini; Hediger; Bayer, 2018, p. 80)

      An anarchival film about Svalbard, fictional or documental, wouldn’t even necessarily requires its filming in the seed vault facilities, neither testimonies of people who constructed the building, but a diving into the fabulatory cartography of events that emerge around it, or in parallel to the physical structure, the address where NGOs and governmental entities send the seeds of the species to be preserved after the end of this world – or which world?
      Both examples of actual archives (that aren’t more real than the archives of fabualtion) oppose what Agostinho (2006, p. 442) calls the “fantasies of dematerialization” sustained by the myth of obsolescence of physical media apparatuses. Like the Campinas bank complex that could be filled with bodies of aliens and extraterrestrial technology Area51 alike, the “physical” archive is only hidden and inaccessible, giving the illusion that everything floats on clouds existing under an ethereal reality, feeding myth-makers.2
      Other exponents of the “anarchival cinema" that aim to explore hidden layers of the archival construction of the typical experiences of a city or territory can be discussed. Allana Thain analyses works of Canadian director Guy Maddin. My Winnipeg, a “walking film” composed of layers of media archive and the city’s architecture, like Georges Perec’s tentative to exhaust a place in Paris through descriptions divided by many layers, doing a “diagram of that city shot through at every level with the uncanny liveliness of the media archive” (Thain, 2010, p. 65). His style is defined by “his typical plundering of stylistic archives [...] mapped onto what he calls “docu-fantasia” of his own life and milieu” (Ibid.). Maddin works through murmurs “emerged in the superposed mappings of city and self via cinema” (Thain, 2010, p. 66); traces of the past that leak into the presentness but aren't themselves exhibited as proper defined historical pieces.
      Deleuze’s argument of the powers of the false, developed in Difference and Repetition and Cinema II books, bears strong relations with temporality. In the past, everything is true, it already is and was. But is it future or is it past? To fabulate is to bring back many of those ghostly pasts into narrative again, without aiming to establish a formal and predicative truth. Which past is true and which is false? That doesn’t matter, since the anthropotechnically constructed man wants the absolute truth in order to find culprits and judge them. The movement that has to be done is to ask if an ethical technique of co-conjuring can bring them back?



  	Works of Maddin and Deborah Stratman (The Illinois Parables) propose to a a a a aaaaaa narc hive cities and environments through speculative exercises acting upon an excess of recovered clips and pictures. They can be viewed as a response to the pertinent question posed by Frederik Tygstrup (2016, p. 97) “by the beginning of the 21st century, these media of speculation seem to have reached a point of excess”, creating the necessity to “diagnose the fate of fiction in an age of hypertrophied speculation”, with whom we refer the abundance of archive material as exemplified and used by Laurie Anderson, speaking about the physical archives built to shelter the servers and hard disks that host the files of the government, not denying the speculative propositions that circulate as memes, fake news alerts, etc. Grønstad speak about physical archives in terms of the nature as an archive, analyzing Patricio Guzmán’s El Botón de Nacar (2015), a film that reflects upon the never found bodies of people killed by the Chilean government during its military dictatorship period. We could also add to that the overproduction of content by some platforms, mostly user-generated, that makes it as impossible to roll a page until its end, as reading all its topics because of the instantaneous production of excessive responses, emitted by humans or bots - for example a thread in 4chan or the main page of Pandlr’s message board (more to come about this platform in the next paragraphs). There’s always an operation of selection, even when it looks like purely contingential; randomly skipping some posts in the thread or picking an aleatory card on the Rolodex after some spinning. Both archiving and anarchiving act through procedures of selection. The latter considers the actual reality and agency of what was left aside or ghosted, not as every single piece of content that must be analyzed and catalogued (the megalomaniac gesture of the pleroma-obsessed oriented) but considering communities of virtual or tiny entities that carry packages of affect-pokers.
     Stratman's filmography is developed through anarchival procedures. From her early films and passing through works like Village, Silenced (2012), a short documentary developed using material from the British propaganda film The Silent Village (1943), directed by Humphrey Jennings, about a German occupied mining village in Czech Republic. She focused on modes of mediatic convocations through the use of the sound (or the silencing of minoritarian voices). On The Illinois Parables, Deborah Stratman used newspapers and found footage of Illinois’ cities mixed with 16mm documentary shot by herself, still pictures, documents from public libraries, to develop twelve parables about cross-historical events that happened in the state of Illinois (US). Defined by critics as “a dense collage of references and viewpoints” (Pattison, 2016), it begins with the expulsion/relocation of aboriginal people when white colonizers arrived. We are not trying to resuscitate the question between “fiction vs. reality” - if we would enter the domain of this discussion we could say that we aim something like what Mark Fisher (2018) and CCRU coined as ‘theory-fiction’, but to see the potential of the spectres in politics and film/photography-making, the powers of the false, or fiction as method, a (non)method that puts artfulness into the agencements of daily life, reaching something that Vilém Flusser would call "reality as fiction". Each parable begins in a predetermined SPAZE-EEE-EEE and time of Illinois. In the first one, we see images of an old map of Cahokia, a pre-Columbian settlement from 600 to 1400 C.E. Its populational peak reached over 40.000. A Shaman plays an ancestral instrument and dances on top of the city ruins, the place to which he goes to reconnect with his ancestors. As Viveiros de Castro says, the Shaman's rattle is her particle accelerator, capable of opening and closing wormholes, or at least putting him in contact with the affects memetically transferred through generations. The second one is supposed to be settled in Alton, 1673. As Blizek (2016, p. 02) says, an infographic shows that the we are supposed to watch a footage from centuries ago, but we see present day signs of “deer attacks”. "In 1673, however, it was our task to live in harmony with nature. When we did not live in harmony with nature the deer attacked. The time is out of joint. The message is that we have not yet learned this lesson and our failure to learn it puts us at risk.” “The deer will attack.” The Illinois Parables deals with a traumatic past of displacement, slavery and consuming natural resources looking for a future with fabulatory potential that grows from the ghostly traces of other eras, which resonates with previous works of the director, aiming to prompt a people yet to come. “The deer will attack” - causality is not linear, thus cross-temporal, since elements from other eras still prevail in our times living with the new dangers brought by the exhaustion of this world made by the anthropotechnical aim to control. This text is neither linear and each repetition produces a new iteration or cartographic layer under Deborah’s fabulatory map-filming. Dislocating (or spectrally disjointing) past and future, this kind of work acts as pieces of resistance to traditional forms of temporality that are imposed, as well the linear archive organizations (if that is even possible). It is also the role of audiovisual processes that can be characterized as Afro and Gulf or Sino Futurism to “unhinge existing temporal schemes and complexify already existing regimes of time as forms of power” (Parikka, 2017, p. 05).

  Using pamphlets and old tabloids filled with folkloric narratives like menaces of spiritual hauntings and multiple supposed cases of SHC (spontaneous human combustion), the main character (if applicable) of her film not is Illinois per se, or the actual state (and also the actual state!), but the fabulatory map that is constituted by layers of perspectives. Or, better explained, not a mapping of the American state, but fabulatory and political cartographies that can be traced to ages before colonization and the entrance into the Anthropocene3 as a key element; as if this topological map was drawn connecting the dots of the spectres that inhabit Illinois (what today is known as Illinois). Ghostly cartographies. It also informs us that the first nuclear chain reaction took place in Illinois in 1942. For the film, it is considered as an event that changed the event’s (state of things, assemblage, or, not a synonym, the ecology) perspective forever, as Souriau would say. Some places, people say, still show a strange level of radiation more than eight decades after the incident. Narratives that relate the nuclear energy war experiments to a major changing of the state of things (besides the actual explosion and the visible destruction brought by it) are somewhat common. As if they were capable to put the world out of joint. In the eighth episode of the third and highly fabulatory/spectral season of Twin Peaks (2017), the nuclear explosion provoked an imbalance of power between different dimensions that allowed some entities to navigate through rifts and invade other realities. It is the case of Judy, a powerful and evil spectre that flew from the Black Lodge to our reality along with its ally Bob, a ghost-like creature that uses human beings’ bodies to kill and pursue his mischievous desires (see figure x) - it is not by chance that David Lynch’s status as the “filmmaker of the dream world” brought to his film scripts ideas that appeared during sessions of in depth Tibetan meditation, and that the unified subject defying entity of the doppelgänger is one of the key-marks of late Lynchian cinema. Some could agree that those entities that cannot be directly seen with bare eyes, but have a huge causal role in the actualization of the world (as the global warming), could be seen as spectres or what Timothy Morton (2013) calls “Hyperobjects”.4 They can, for sure, produce a spectral effect, and accepting them with unconditional hospitality, as Derrida opposes conditional hospitality, cannot be understood as an unconditional acceptance of their fulfilment through the path of ultimate acceleration, but as their virtual traces that already haunt the future. "As Land remarks of hyperstitial: "Just because it's not 'real' now, doesn't mean it won't be real at some point in the future. And once it's real, in a sense, it's always been".5

  	The question again is how to keep the fabulation alive and propose playful/mischievous modes of existence in a world that sees the two of its biggest menaces as misinformation and the staggering effects that it can produce (and it’s already done). My guess is that one exercise I can propose involves a, alluding to Alfred Jerry, pataphysical ethics of acceptance (non-judgmental amor fate) and hos(ti)pitality of the spectral potential despite its dangerousness. We must reassure, though, that this is not the same as a “reflexive impotence”, a term used by Mark Fisher to describe a state of things in which people agree that things are failing and there’s not so much left to be done, it’s impossible to change them.6 The conditions for changing, we aim, are already present in the spectral qualities of failures and non-actualized (or virtual) states of things, including the techniques already being used.

  	Stratman points out a myriad of figures that interests her in the form and editing of her movies, like “intervals, gaps, holes, circuits and loops” (Stratman, 2014, MC). The last one, she argues, is related to a paranoid feeling that emerged after 9/11 and mass surveillance: “layers of fabrication, layers of control” (Ibid.), resonating with Heart of a Dog's comments on surveillance. As we pointed above, works like hers and the films of Guy Maddin are interested in the process of anarchiving cities, and an a a a a aaaaaa narc hive explicitly involves what is not there: what was there but is not anymore, what is not there but can in the future, or what is there is no guarantee that it is there. “Fascism produces singularities that retell stories of belonging, that create regressive attachments” (Manning, 2012, p. 53). I should add, fascism tells histories with very clear ancestral beginnings, and with very clear endings. All that is in between suffers a process of intense retconning. “Fascism predicts the ending and moves toward it, suicidally” (Ibid.). By all means, if we assume that history is a social and biased construct, what remains is the spectral mischievousness of fabulation - “questioning facticity” (Ibid.)-, targeting and using those gaps as a storytelling - and I have big objections with this word - device. A gap7 can be “a gap between a thing and its name, sound and image” (Stratman, 2014, MC). As any anarchival practice should run, she states that we should, instead of recognizing the advantage of what is, “recognize the usefulness of what isn’t, what is not there”. Agreed! Although, I would add - we should recognize the uselessness8 of what still isn’t and maybe will be.9 Phantom eels are missing and then submersed spectres of anthropocenic sinkholes start to disjoint daily life in a community settlement. “Unintentional aspirant to the conditions of cinema, a sinkhole is fundamentally an edit in the landscape. Terrestrial features, intimating an incremental, geological time, they can also be sudden, cataclysmic events. As with caves, sinkholes are living organisms, with “bloodstreams and respiratory systems, infections and infestations”.
  (…) the force of fabulation, a telling poised at the limit of articulation, a telling, as one character explains, of a past “not in my system.” Fabulation is about the event, the event of time: fabulation is not the telling of a narrative in the form of the “what was,” but the expression of “the act of legending.” is act creates not a truth but an opening onto the aberrant movement of time where the surface of the film itself begins to “ fiction,” to “legend” or fabulate, where the character (the surface) begins to “fabulate without ever being fictional” and where the filmmaker cannot but “‘intercede himself ’ from the real characters who wholly replace his own fiction through their own fabulations” (Deleuze 1991, 150; translation modified qtd. Manning, 2012, p. 44)

  (Pause. trying to anarchive a piece of PhD thesis

  Charlie Brooker, The Guardian’s journalist famous for creating the television series Black Mirror, used to present his retrospective at the end of each year. In December 2014, along with the airing of its Charlie Brooker’s 2014 Wipe, a segment was shown of a not-yet-released (at the time) documentary entitled Bitter Lake, created and directed by Adam Curtis. The segment, presented as a short film, Oh Dearism II - Non Linear Warfare, narrated by the British documentarist, tries to explain what “non-linear warfare”, a term created in a short story by Nathan Dubovitsky, is. Firstly presenting a myriad of enunciations that hit us during that year through occidental mainstream media, like Ebola, ISIS (Islamic State), Ukraine, Syria, decapitations, pedophilia scandals, claims that those topics were so exhausted by language and the spreading of fake news - a term not yet popularized at the time, elected the word of the year in 2016 by Oxford Dictionaries following the election of Donald Trump and the allegations that it was influenced by Russian state-funded bots that spread non-verified news through social networks - apparently couldn’t mean anything anymore, in a sense they could not be believed. The only gesture that can be done being confronting with those enunciations and images is to say “Oh, Dear”. This incessant production of truths that seem to be the same, but only with different vectoral directions (cf. Deleuze, 2004), happening at an absurd speed, is a “power strategy that makes every opposition constantly confuse”. Besides the known allegations on Curtis about his work acting itself a kind of conspiracy-theorists attractor and sensationalist, and his exhaustively repetitive formula, it’s interesting to see some of his arguments, in order to further develop a well-established difference between fake news and fabulation (or what we call fab news). In an informational war (that may include a cultural war), the “objective is not to win the battle, but to use the conflict to create a constant state of destabilized perception”, making it easier to be modulated. Curtis blames Vladislav Surkov, an advisor of Vladimir Putin, for helping to create this state of perceptual disorder, using techniques that come from his avant-garde art and theatre academic background, applied to economics and politics. Besides these simplistic affirmations and relations, that came after the Brexit referendum, we can’t deny that misunderstanding is one of the best partners of diagrammatic control. What we would like to capture from this piece is the following utterance by a journalist quoted in the film: “a ceaseless shapeshifting, unstoppable, because it’s undefinable”.10 Fabulous news aim to work besides the dichotomy of 'truth' and 'fake news', and it takes into consideration that “behind the term post-truth there is the implicit assertion that there was once a time “pre" post-truth, a time in which politics hewed more closely to a reality taken to be objective, a fixed set of memories that should stuck and produce stuckness on us, reneging that "memory on the making is the activation of the power of the false that re-creates the present through a complete remix of fabulation and pasties beyond any notion of true" (Manning, 2012, p. 84). “Taking a long historical view allows us to see that there are precedents to the current situation that complicate the narrative of a pre-post-truth world." (Shaw; Reeves-Evison, 2018, p. 26). Last but not least, "fabulation is not a negative, reactionary telling, but that which actively resists punitive judgments that are driven by social and historical norms. It is a legending process that in falsifying normative, majoritarian predilections affirms thinking and living life as a creative force" (Garoian, 2018, p. 192). It feeds from and towards the Nietzschean powers of the false, what is minimal, non-actualized or non-recognized by ontological systems of knowledge and perceptions, like the spectral qualities that were forgotten but that keep being felt.

  Deleuze’s powers of the false finds its corollary in what Nietzsche has described as the will to power. That is, the powers of the false are an affirmation of the unthought or what otherwise might be called the virtual. This affirmation of the virtual is not simply oriented to what is and what everyone already knows, since, in Deleuzian terms, the virtual is real without being actual.  More adequately, the virtual is the unthought or plastic force through which a thing might enter into relation with what it is not.  It is the potential of difference or, put differently, a force of deterritorialization through which the actual might be metamorphosed. (Wallin, 2011, p. 107)
     end of ( )

  	Our proposition works through two different approaches. After analyzing both movies and establishing relations within their minor companions, we aim to discuss spectrality and a a a a aaaaaa narc hives in digital cinema archives like KG [name suppressed to protect its users and staff]. Or, instead of discussing them we will use them to mine qualities and contents for our anarchival film project, constituted of found footage and exercises of conjuration for boring evenings [or how to stay upside down for four hours]. One of the issues with the expression "mining'’ is that sometimes it presupposes the extraction of something from a certain environment. For example, I take this rock from the beach and take it to another place, which is not per se problematic unless it's done in massive scale. And what the fuck is massive scale for you.The second part is the development of a video piece that resonates with the blob-≋ world-building distribution. We believe, however, that according to the contemporary screen ecologies, the manners in which individuals relate to archives and spectres from the (sometimes, very near) past, is charged with the adoption of a fast transmutation of contents into new images or videos, crowded with references and quick shots/cuts, something that certainly has already been extensively analyzed by works on remix culture. Instead, an audiovisual process that aims to deal with spectres that still haunt us and to fabulate over the surplus or plethora, without seeking to construct a piece based on a pleroma. This fabulation can, for example, neglect stimuli excesses and velocity, appealing to slowness and other plane velocities. This is valid both to recovered images or the ones we aim to film. There’s an ethics in form (cf. Grønstad, 2016). An ethical gesture would allow that disparate gaze speeds live together in an ecology of perspectives, as Viveiros de Castro or Souriau would say, against the preponderance of a rapid gaze and planes in media/screen ubiquity environments.



     Also, being a research-creation proposition that aims to create an audiovisual piece, we shall establish some enabling constraints (Manning; Massumi, 2014). I) Following Grønstad ethical discussion against the scopic entelechy, the work must be made giving screen to multiple minor visualities, not (necessarily) human, following what Massumi (2014, p. 35) denominates a “mutual inclusion of at least two non-coinciding perspectives”. II) Promote an ecology of velocities (of gaze, planes, gestures, etc.); what should be, for example, a spectral gaze, or one that makes voices of tiny existences (as the phantasmal body of the resurrected or the invisible traces of the failure) resonate? III: (An) archival work is done not only by addition and excess but also by subtracting from the plethora. IV) The piece must be processual, and some propositions may not be realized, if felt, for example, that there is more appetite for filming with the own apparatus than selecting and retrieving material from the archives before mentioned. V) To do it collectively.
  This sounds a bit odd. Maybe you can just say “filming”

  also.. what is different from filming to selecting? I think you could elaborate a bit on that because I think those techniques don’t need to be that different. Isn’t filming also a way of selecting? Also I’m not sure about the word selecting when it comes down to retrieving material from archives. Sounds a bit like mining no? Don’t you know a more fun word to use instead?

	When the TV program talked about Cazuza1’s death because of AIDS I must have been around nine years old. An older cousin was sitting by my side. I asked my cousin "What is AIDS?" and he quickly replied: "It's a disease developed by fags." And so begins a trajectory whose flows, vigils, semens, dances and dreams indicate a path towards the end of stereotyped representations.
	The unfolding of this first information on AIDS does not intend and could not create any kind of linear narrative, no cause-and-effect logic. What exists is a tangle of possibilities, of (dis)organizations in motion. The chaining of the facts has to do with that sentence today; I rewrite it on the same computer on which I have edited film experiments and through which I connect to Kekeland Wi-Fi network, named after a song by French singer and writer Brigitte Fontaine, one of the few written by her in English. Kekeland is a land imagined by Brigitte where cock suckers, assholes and motherfuckers coexist. Brigitte auto-proclaims herself the queen of Kekeland where she lives with the Kekes. Together 'they go to the market while drinking boiling liquids. They buy handsome poets and eat pepper. Kekes are always drunk ‘cause they smell the finest airs and each of them keeps an old punk in a bed full of flowers. They have big eyes and red hair and they live in blue valleys where they travel in montgolfiers. The sea of ​​Kekeland is always green and its palace full of sand.’2
	While connected to kekeland network I try to scribble a relation of  the events whose syntax may shatter the television room where "It's a disease developed by fags" was uttered.
I’m not interested in my emotions insomuch as their being mine, belonging only, uniquely, to me. I’m not interested in their individual aspects, only in how they are traversed by what isn’t mine. In what emanates from our planet’s history, the evolution of living species, the flux of economics, remnants of technological innovations, preparation for wars, the trafficking of organic slaves and commodities, the creation of hierarchies, institutions of punishment and repression, networks of communication and surveillance, the random overlapping of market research groups, techniques and blocs of opinion, the biochemical transformation of feeling, the production and distribution of pornographic images. (Preciado 2013: 11, 12)
	It is about creating space for an insistent, loose reverberation of unheard words, "murmur of dark insects" (Foucault 2006a: xxxiii). Invasion done by footprints, climbing and by touch, saliva. Rethink the imposed geography. When this other space, empty and populated at the same time, is found, perhaps, that which does not exist and which we do not know about, will be produced. The chronologies here serve only to sketch and diagram a corporeal-temporal map of the experiences, without the pretense of establishing any kind of qualitative hierarchy that would correlate duration to intensity. After all, "sometimes one second is enough while thirty years have not given anything"3 (Fontaine 2012: 23)
	In 2008, I was living in Copenhagen. It was early summer, I was on vacation from the Commedia School and worked every day in an Italian restaurant located in Islands Brygge in the port region. There was a strait where I sometimes plunged into after work despite the cold water. The average Danish summer temperature is 16 degrees Celsius. The work in the restaurant lasted around 4 hours a day. My job was to clean. One night I finished working at "Il Pane di Mauro" and went by bike to a downtown pub. I ordered a glass of wine and sat down at a table to read. I'll make it up it was Virginia Woolf's "Orlando” that I read. Virginia Woolf’s character Orlando makes me think of Christopher, the Danish guy I met that night. I lean on an excerpt on memory written by Woolf herself so asto put the book in my hands:
Memory runs her needle in and out, up and down, hither and thither. We know not what comes next , or what follows after. Thus, the most ordinary movement in the world, such as sitting down at a table and pulling the inkstand towards one, may agitate a thousand odd, disconnected fragments, now bright, now dim, hanging and bobbing and dipping and flaunting, like the underlinen of a family of fourteen on a line in a gale of wind. Instead of being a single, downright, bluff piece of work of which no man need feel ashamed, our commonest deeds are set about with a fluttering and flickering of wings, a rising and falling of lights... memory is inexplicable..  (Woolf 1928: 52)

	From the place where I sat with the glass of wine and the book in hands, I saw the boy writing at a table. He had long hair, a fringe covered half of his face. Watching him writing on the small notebook became indispensable. I started creating strategies to walk past his table. We exchanged looks. At one of these strategic crossings he looked at me and said, "You're welcome to sit" and pointed to the empty chair in front of him. I sat down. We started talking and asking for alcoholic shots. Several. Of different colors. Suddenly he read me a sentence amidst his notes: "Everything chaotically falls into place". We talked a lot. No matter the contents, 'what matters are the compositions of relations that made us cross the world with certain gestures, accents, connections, sounds and vocal reactions, ways of looking' (Amalio, Pinheiro) We were a bit dizzy when he asked me: - Are you gay? I said yes and replied: - What about you? He answered: - No, but I want you to fuck me. We decided to go to his house. We went on my bike. He took the seat and I sat on the saddle. It was the first time I rode clinging to someone's waist. We stopped at three or four pubs before we reached his place. His bedroom was a mattress on the floor, a desk and a clothes rack. I woke up during the night and his hair covered half my face. We spent four days wandering around the city. A few weeks later, he invited me to a party. The room full of strangers. Christopher who opened the door. His friends approached. In a gesture, he exclaimed: "Guys, this is Ernesto, the guy who fucked me”. I was surrounded by hugs, drinks and various exclamations ..
      ... I want to find ways to expose thoughts around an issue that allow the multiplicity of things to prevail,  that turn the subject matter into some decomposable material, whose form is undone, refracted and modified at great speed. Ways that know objects have a previous and intense life to the eyes that find them forgotten in a corner. Object and subject never come to a final term, but constitute themselves simultaneously amid politics of touch through which
	the body resists the state. Touch as reaching-toward foregrounds the unknowability at the heart of all bodies of knowledge, reminding us that we cannot know the body as the state claims we do, for no body is ever thoroughly articulated. Every body moves differently, in-difference to the state. (Manning 2007: 63)

	I see the image of the TV room collapsing. It collapses to serve a reconstruction, that will make other rooms collapse, successively…
The plenitude of history is only possible in the space, both empty and peopled at the same time, of all the words without language that appear to anyone who lends an ear, as a dull sound from beneath history, the obstinate murmur of a language talking to itself – without any speaking subject and without an interlocutor, wrapped up in itself, with a lump in its throat, collapsing before it ever reaches any formulation and returning without a fuss to the silence that it never shook off. The charred root of meaning. (Foucault 1960: 22)
	I perceived my desire as different from my cousins ​​and uncles. Not only in relation to the male body but also to my choices when playing superheroes. "It's a disease developed by fags" added to my doubts the fear that I might have AIDS. The kid in that TV room did not know anything about penetration, or the amount of virus in the semen, blood. I started to relate my desire as the possible causer / transmitter of such a disease. It was silently or sometimes babbling some words that I would talk to myself. There is no appeal to commiseration here. On the contrary, the aim is to expose the potency of body-environment exchanges; of the traces left by the encounters with other bodies that would help crumble that room where my desire had been tied to the risk of sickness and death. In 2000, I started studying journalism at Federal University of Pernambuco and enrolled in a philosophy course. The professor entered the room and before introducing herself wrote a sentence on the blackboard: "Reality is far beyond understanding ..." (Lispector, Clarice) .. She then gave a whole lecture on Clarice Lispector. In the end, I asked her which of the author's book she would suggest me to read. “Near to the wild heart" she replied. I went straight to the library and read the first paragraph still in the lobby:
Her father’s typewriter went clack-clack... clack-clack-clack... The clock awoke in dustless tin-dlen. The silence dragged out zzzzzzz. What did the wardrobe say? clothes-clothes-clothes. No, no. Amidst the clock, the type-writer and the silence there was an ear listening, large, pink and dead. The three sounds were connected by the daylight and the squeaking of the tree’s little leaves rubbing against one another radiant  (Lispector 1990: 3)

	I closed it. Something in that writing, in the title of the book and in the narratives I had just heard in the classroom, made me in a totally disjointed, confused way, glimpse 'my infinite degree in nature' (Spinoza).
	And under the yellow sun, sitting on a stone, without the least guarantee - the man now rejoiced as if not understanding was a creation. This caution that a person has to transform the thing into something comparable and then approachable, and only from that moment of security, to look and allow themselves to see because fortunately it will be too late not to understand - that concern Martim had lost. And not understanding was suddenly giving him the whole world. (Lispector 1998: 34)
	During our Clown studies at the Commedia School an English dancer came to prepare a choreography for the clowns. He chose the song "Steam Heat" by Jerry Ross for us to dance. We were invited to perform the dance at a clown festival in Assens, a small town on the west coast of Denmark. At the end of the presentation, a Danish lady came to me and introduced herself: "I am a witch. I am your Danish mother. And you have the heart of a dancer”. I believe in witches. Some years later, in São Paulo, I began to study dance in Communication of the Arts of the Body and I came across the ideas around the corpomedia theory:
	... the body is not a processor because processors do not changeshape when  dealing with the information they relate to. A television does not shine more or less when it announces a bomb killing civilians in Egypt nor the birth of a panda bear at the zoo. A blender does not change its appearance when processing a potato soup nor a milkshake. But the body, yes, transforms itself into the type of information with which it deals precisely because it transforms it into body.  (Greiner; Katz 2015: 9)
	When information comes in contact with the body it stays, it spreads, it may change the breathing, the walking and cause tachycardia. What information causes in a body is a tangle of possibilities, of (re)organizations, dances. “One is space of relation: there is no unified body. There are skins, receptive surfaces, gestural movements, desires towards an other” (Manning 2007: 61) "It is a disease developed by fags" is the proof of the unstable and mobile quality of information-body-environment relations:
	In 2014, through an online access to the laboratory where I had been tested, I got a positive serological testing for the HIV virus. If I write about it here, it is because the experiences and readings and meetings of the last few months have allowed me to take distance from this fact, to take it in my hands as “my body becomes world. The senses translate the body not as the individual but as the relational exchange between worlds and bodies” (Manning 2007: 61). The fact is that I had an unusual relation to the virus. My CD4, which are the cells of the immune system attacked by HIV were already at a very low level, although the infection had occurred just over a year, according to my last negative test. I immediately started treatment with antiretrovirals. A few months later, I began to feel an insistent headache. I went to the emergency room at a hospital a few times, and although I reported on low CD4 and HIV, they would take some exams and send me back home. I began to get very weak inside my apartment. One day, on the phone with my mother, to whom I had not told about anything, I began to cry. She sensed something and without telling me she took a flight to São Paulo. The doctors did not know what caused the constant headache. I could no longer read. I spent entire days lying down, eyes closed. I tried acupuncture, massages and even psychoanalysis sessions. My mother and I developed a sort of Beckettian relationship inside my apartment in São Paulo. At one point, we did not turn to anyone else, she just went out to buy food. I could barely eat, I vomited everything. One night I started getting very dizzy, it was difficult to walk. We went to the emergency room for three days in a row and finally, on the third day, they asked for a cerebrospinal fluid test, which is done through a lumbar puncture. They found out I had meningitis. I was taken directly to the Intensive Care Unit.
	I knew my friends and family were outside, but those relations were blur, they dissolved into the point where I became ... an any-body struggling to stand up and take a shower by myself. One of the strategies of the exhausted body to stay alive is to draw energy from its own muscles. The body starts to eat itself. I had lost 31 pounds which left my most basic support muscles very weak. "The exhausted are those who had the strength ‘to produce holes, to loosen the tourniquet of words, to dry the exudation of voices in order to detach themselves from memory and reason" (Pelbart 2016: 43) There was a beauty in the possibility of observing, adult, the dissolution and reconstruction of my own body. The verb to observe can only be used by my body that writes today. In those early days at the ICU, nothing remained, everything "was pure image, an intensity that puts words away, dissolves stories and memories, stores a fantastic potential energy ..." (Perlbart 2016: 43) I vaguely remember the faces that came into the room to visit me. I recall the feeling of not sharing the anguish they had in their eyes. Within that fragility, near-death, I experienced an extraordinary strength devoid of subjectivity. It was no longer Ernesto, son of Maria Helena, uncle of Letícia; at the same time that it was very difficult for me to walk to the bathroom, look straight, I felt intensely connected to an extraordinary force of everything that is alive ...
The life of the individual gives away to an impersonal and yet singular life that releases a pure event freed from the accidents of internal and external life, that is, from the subjectivity and objectivity of what happens... the life of such individuality fades away in favor of the singular life immanent to a man who no longer has a name, though can be mistaken for no other. A singular essence, a life... (Deleuze 1968: 27)
	At the end of 2017, I went filming with some friends in Chapada dos Veadeiros in the State of Goiás. We arrived at the first waterfall. I was the first one to dive into the icy water and swim to the huge cascade that fell from the rock. As soon as I got under the waterfall I began to scream. It was the only possible reaction. The first images that came to me concomitant to the shouts and the sensation of the cold water on my head were the images of my hospitalization, of the near-death at the hospital. That waterfall was the proof that "the events that constitute a life coexist with the accidents of the life that corresponds to it, but they are neither grouped nor divided in the same way…” (Deleuze 1968: 28)
      HIV made me experience a (dis)order extraneous to the coherence of the organs. It made me jump of joy in my living room as I understood for the first time what Judith Butler meant when she spoke of the drag queen's performance as cultural evidence of the mechanisms that produce the coherence of  "sexual identity and ensure the link between anatomical sex and gender" (Preciado 2014: 91) It is actually HIV inserted in my choices, in the icy bay where I insisted on plunging in Islands Brygge; in the long hair Danish poet who now has two children and exclaimed to a room full of friends about the night on his mattress; in my astonishment to look at my mother and realize that we had spent nine months together, the time of a second gestation, despite my height and weight; in a belief in the world that “is about crafting the conditions to encounter the world differently each time” (Manning 2016: 93);  in my attraction to the idea of performance as an "operator of destabilization of other artistic languages" (Greiner 2013) that made me realize that I do not have to be bound nor belong to any artistic way of doing. No categories established a priori. A singular presence as a choice.






1 Brazilian singer and song writer who died of AIDS in 1990
2 Part of the lyrics of the song Kékéland by Brigitte Fontaine and Areski Belkacem. From the album Kékéland released in 2001 by Virgin France S.A.  “I know ten cock suckers And a little asshole A hundred mother fuckers So I'm never alone/ You know I am the queen The queen of Kékéland My sea is ever green My palace full of sand/ I wear veiled battle dress Covered with pearls and roses I'm the royal mistress Of the bodies and souls My subjects are kékés With big red eyes and hair They live in blue valleys Travel in montgolfière / They go to the market Drinking boiling liquors They buy a pretty poet Come back to eat pepper / Kékés are always drunk 'Cause they smell finest airs Each keeps an old punk In white bed full of flowers They have under their skin The beloved precious Lord That makes them laugh and grin When they go overboard / If one day the missiles Come for the big finish Kékés will keep their smile They know how to vanish”
