a number of propositions (11, or infinite) for fabulation

i.  Fabulation always emerges with sparks or what Adam Wolfond calls "blast of the whole... forging like a mass inside my eyes.”. Fabulation is immediate, in-forming of forces. It thrives in and generates more appetite, always more. Appetition. Activation.  ~ More life, now!

Becoming pop is when the whole so-called insides of a bodying burst out from the body in a rushed plop and at the same time, get uncontained and try with all the machines to pretend containment not truly for others but mostly for the operation’s sake. Like when in the middle of reading or in the middle of walking or let’s say in the middle of wandering, ‘something’ crosses, the suggestion of a universe flashes itself out and bathes the whole fielding into a non-end-non-beginning plane that swallows it all, provoking the inevitable involuntary burst, in the feeling of burst, uncontainment becomes irresistible for itself and pushes at great speed in order to reach and join the rays of the overtaken field. Like when a bite of a mango invades all experience and leaves room for nothing else or like when a ray of purpleness cuts through the gut of the universe and swallows perception into no-longer perceptibility but mere feeling lives.

ii.  Fabulation moves in the continuous exploration of the event, in the event’s unfolding. Like Tito says “ “. This exploration is always in drift, in play with all the tendencies (as virtual poles) that enter the event, making them mix but never confusing them. The nip is play and fight at the same time,

A glaze of infinite orange metal enamel cup sparks all experience, inflecting (reflect forward, as Bateson would say) novel universes in its wake

iii.  Fabulations move with creatures, that is, little creation that move on themselves, crossing from conceptual persona to aesthetic figures to observers, and across concepts, sensations, and functions. A bit like what Blanchot said about Nietzsche, “[he] possessed a nearly infinite capacity for precise ideas that were separate and rigorously formulable, each of them alive in the manner of a tiny organism.” (xx) Tiny organisms as creations, that is fabulatory, be it they move with concepts, sensations, or functions, they are all alive in their spirit -- abstractions are very living! they are intensificators, operators of the virtual.

Iv. It is fully perspectival, of different worlds. It sustains not by making one world more consistent or more solid, but by thriving between an ever increasing plurality of worlds. A life always emerges between, across the thresholds that stipulate these worlds. which is, as Whitehead calls it, the becoming of continuity ( xx).

v.  Fabulation populates in always in tending to the minor, that is, it concerns populating with virtual modes of existence, or that which is more than. It is a filling, but not directional, or intentional, or representational; it rather welters, spills, and leaks because its filling is not so much the content but what exceeds it, that splash of soup that went out of the pot.

“It is just that there is not a single mode of existence for all the beings that pop-ulate the world.” (Lapoujade )

vi.  The people are missing; for a people to come. Don’t you see? It is always a matter of survival, it is where minor socialities create new spaces, their places, however strange; it is where other modes of existence become more real, more intense.

vii.  Speculative but fully material, always in practice; fabulation is practice as much as it is technique, moving in the schizz of experience. Fabulation thus always involves shifts, it involves shifts in cutting across modes of experience. Its shifting, its inflecting, resists capture in any sense of faculty (Reason) or another a priori determined form (Intentionality). Fabulation is sideways; it is not the imagination of something, nor the intending to something, it is felt at the edges, co-composing with existence. Perhaps fabulation is imagination in the Spinozean sense, but never is it a faculty of Reason or a product of intention.

Becoming fab is attuning to something you don’t know exactly yet can attune by moving sideways. Like when tr(a)ying to reach something that falls behind the fridge.

Something falls behind the fridge.

viii.  Fabulation is magical and fully real. Shamanistic, fabulation is “holding two thoughts at the same time.” Thus fabulation tends more to rituals than to procedures.

ix.  Intercessors, always intercessors. Everything can become an intercessor, the tiniest mode of existence can bring about the hugest cosmos. Intercessors are needed for creation. The filmmaker can be the intercessor for a people to come, but at the same time the people can be an intercessor for a film to come; and the fish can be an intercessor for a emergent collectivity, while the pink paint can be the intercessor for another world, however painful.

x.  Dreaming. “Even Descartes had his dream.”

xi. Clinical: Fabulation is, in its schizzing the world, that world that weighs so heavily and that exhausts, not because the content has been emptied out (depletion, or fatigue) but because the possible, imagination, has been exhausted, that world becomes multiple, it becomes so many carried on by the vital breath that surges in the middle, in the schizzing of fabulation. In this sense fabulation is fully clinical: it is healing, not of the subject per se, or of the world per se, but of the emergent conditions that intensifies a life.
