“c’est justement qu’il n’y a pas un seul mode d’existence pour tout les êtres qui peuplent le monde.” — “It is just that there is not a single mode of existence for all the beings that pop-ulate the world.” — pop-ulate, un-dulate, éclat : sparks, intensificateurs.

Fabulation is so many things. It is to activate the remainders, to foreground what is left out in experience. Fabulation is the tending to and preparation of emergent conditions with the prudence of the experimenter, with the modest of the people on the line. Fabulation is an ecological imagination that emerges in and with events. It is the play with ghosts of future past and past futures. It is the speculative share of each minor gesture. It is the affirmation of the necessity of chance, that one role that includes all. It is thought shooting across the universe in an instant imagining cosmic creatures. It is the vital breath that surges between an array of possible worlds. Fabulation tends to a people to come, it informs that which is not yet but ready to be both, personal and collective.

Fabulation is the continuous exploration of the event.
