  when a tiger travels to other planets…

Under what circumstances does a tiger pounce? What possesses this cat to swim? To eat a child? To climb a tree? Wait: is a tiger’s -esqueness sufficiently feline to inspire it to climb? To be determined. To be invented. When does a tiger travel to other planets? What makes a tiger fly? [..]. [The child playing tiger] departs from dynamic situations, extending the animal’s -esqueness beyond all known territory.
Brian Massumi, 2014: 84

In What Animals Teach Us About Politics (2014) Massumi describes how a child playing tiger becomes tiger in an intensive becoming of tigritude. Rather than imitating and thus resembling a tiger in any sense, the child becomes tiger in its intensive movements with a processual faitfulness that creates a new variation of tiger (xx). Massumi writes

One look at a tiger, however fleeting and incomplete, whether it be in the zoo or in a book or in a film or video, and presto! the child is tigerized. Transformation-in-place. The perception itself is a vital gesture. The child immediately sets about, not imitating the tiger’s substantial form as he saw it, but rather giving it life—giving it more life. The child plays the tiger in situations in which the child has never seen a tiger. More than that, it plays the tiger in situations no tiger has ever seen, in which no earthly tiger has ever set paw.

The child caught a glimpse of “the dynamism of the tiger, as a form of life.” (xx) It moves through this, with this, across this, and becomes tiger in a mutual inclusion that adds to tiger as much as it adds to child. “This is what the child saw—all of it, in a glimpse; all in a flash. Not just a generic animal shape: a singular vital movement sweepingly immanent to the visible form. What children see: the immanence of a life.” (xx; my emphasis) The child does not see a tiger; it sees tigritude. There is no separating out of this moment of this movement to compare it to any other movements of a tiger, an actual tiger or whatever else in the form of a tiger; on the contrary, everything is swooped up into this moment creating in itself this differing variation of a tiger in its tigeresqueness. It launches “into the improvisational movement of a lived cartography that is one with its own activity.” (xx)

All earthly restraints lose grounds and the event opens to different dimensions: “When does a tiger travel to other planets? What makes a tiger fly?” (xx; my emphasis) The child in tigritude takes on a cosmic bodying that far exceeds any planetary limitations, or any physical limitations for that matter. It launches off beyond space as it creates wholly new spaces, other planets. In the mutual inclusion of this event the tiger itself cannot but become different as its movements carries on to different potentials, new variations. As Massumi says, “Enthusiasm of the body doesn’t sweep up one without sweeping up at least two. It marks an instantaneous transformation-in-place that is immediately transindividual in nature.” (42) It is trans in the sense that it is not between two, the child and the tiger, it is trans because it is the middle that creates the two, that gives space to each in their new variation. The trans of transformation is immediate, crossing the universe in an instant.

There is something fully fabulatory about the event, that moment of exploration when a body in becoming is no longer tied to the earth, when it is swept up launching into cosmic adventure. It is not so much that it takes place on some far away planet relative to the planet of departure, but rather that between the earth and that planet a between emerges which is constitutive of the adventure itself. This means the adventure does not take place there or there, the adventure is the creation of another, co-extensive space itself; adventure is the middle that makes possible the two same yet different planets. That moment that in human eyes can look so insignificant carries with it the force of a completely novel cosmos. But little do humans know…

The child has spent the whole afternoon fabricating this immense constellation in the living room, a cosmos in its own right. The mother comes home and in a sweep of all too humanly habit she clears out all the things and makes the living room ‘habitable’, again. The child cries “but didn’t you see!?” to which the mother with the least concern replies “see what?” (xx)

play

Massumi shows that play can be seen as a new image of thought, a ludic one. What Massumi means by that is that perhaps play conceptualized in this manner could create the conditions that themselves create new thought thinking. The image of thought that is play attunes to immanence moved by what Massumi calls “mutual inclusion.” (xx) In contrast to prior images of thought – perhaps those characterized by Deleuze and Guattari as the different eras of thought philosophy has created, the eidetic, reflective, and communicative (xx) – play is fully ludic
