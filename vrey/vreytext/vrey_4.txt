l. Sewing time. When dancing or fighting with a ghost, envision the ghost.Both our bodies are expelling themselves. Anarchival practices of not being able to be somewhere or sometime. We’re very symbiotic creatures, dancing and appearing and disappearing. I’m so nervous for tomorrow morning, I know you’ll be here, but still you’ll be sleeping so I think I’ll feel like going in circles again and again and again. Waiting all those long few minutes for an extra stripe to appear or never appear. I heard that after the appearing happened for four minutes you shouldn’t look at the stripes anymore, because then a second stripe could appear without meaning it wanted to appear. It can just come without having to mean anything. The first stripe could even disappear without that meaning anything. It’s so scary to feel so much distance to my organs. Everybody’s asking what I’m feeling, but I’m not feeling anything anymore. The only thing I remember was my instancious feeling and I think I should keep remembering that in order to stay calm. It’s not that I don’t want a ghost travelling inside me; something that escaped the event of us meeting and travelled across the ocean, but it just doesn’t seem like it did. It would have been easier if it wasn’t across the ocean and maybe a year later. It is very strange, this possibility of not choosing to have something living with you, and having to remember and re-remember all the moments, repeating them in our minds; did something happen that we missed? Did something slip our memory? It would be beautiful, it would be very persistent; like most of our ghosts are. And it is so strange, something going on ‘inside’, while I don’t even think I believe  in an inside like that. But still, having no idea of what is going on inside there. We can only guess. Often our guessing is affected by anxiety. Those two stripes, I’m sure I want to check them and see them again and again, flipping my eyes between the clock and the stripes. I can only look at them for four minutes, then they won’t ‘mean’ anything anymore. What if the stripes turn into the arms of the clocks? I’ll see the two arms making circles, my arms trying to capture the stripe so I can show you and myself, the stripe appearing as one but maybe soon as double.I was expecting some anarchival qualities to come with the rolls of film that I brought from Denmark, I've read that the X-ray machines can produce undesirable effects on the pictures. That's everything I ever wanted; to have some ghosts in my images. However, I developed the first film and there was nothing. Only reinforcing my idea that it's hard for those ghosts to appear when there's a very specific and determinate desire of the aesthetical form they should present themselves in (like when I used to expect to finally be abducted by aliens during my sleep when I was a child). Well, also I've read that that affects only film with sensitivities higher than 800 ISO and the X-ray in the checked luggage is way stronger, which made my will almost impossible with the Snappy camera that accepts only 400 ISO and the low cost flight of WOW // spoiler: I bought a new camera on eBay and it's really weird but still didn't arrive // Maybe I should put them inside an MRI machine, which also is one of the first scenes of Riget (I'm loving to watch this tv-show again). But also I figured that the ghosts are there in another forms that were not detectable by our figurative way of looking into pictures. We should attend more to the minimal beings that are hardly visible only with the sense of sight. Maybe we need more haptic ghosts. Should I answer you in a more direct manner? I feel that I never respond to what you say, at least in a typical way… I'm super happy about the stripes!! But also super sad about the body in stress/unrestness. I guess it's a kind of media apparatus we could work more with, appearing and disappearing letters, like when you did the wet reading (but also like those pens children use to cheat on exams, that can write and be erased really easily…). I found the heaviest material in this world. It is as big as a grain of sand, but is as heavy as a stone you’d normally carry with two hands. It’s laying in the palm of my hand. It would’ve fit on my fingertip but my finger simply bends too heavily when I tried to hold it there. Carrying in my closed hand works, and then just opening it when I show it to every body around me. I’m so fond of it, I can’t help myself but show it. I have to bend my arm a bit, you can see my muscles flexing when I lower my hand and open the fingers. First I did some research. I was just naively googling things as “heaviest particle” and I finally found the right material, it wasn’t that hard. There are so many schemes and indexes, a lot of humans sadly enough have always been obsessed with structuring. Luckily I had a lover working in chemical engineering. He used to work on reactor membranes, which was tricky because the membrane had to vacuolize the right amount of oxygen but at the same time make sure to not give a particular reaction, like oxygenation. I drove to where he lives here in the Netherlands, really close to the sea and when I got back home I put it on a stack of fabrics. It’s so beautiful to see such a small grain making such an impact, drawing the fabrics to the wooden floor. What’s nice about giving presentations is that it’s easier to steal words and weave them like your dreams would, naturally and mischievously, your own and others, well they were never anyone’s to begin with, always a leaky sense of words. I just took some words from you and me and other readings I love. It’s nice to speak out both what you and I have written. Speaking our dialogue out load, which was never a dialogue to begin with. But to switch from my dusty pores to “a 30 year old talking to a little girl” is extraordinarily beautiful. The heaviest things I have been handling recently are not actualized in a rock or something like that but are the emails I read when I wake up. Every day, at least 10 notifications of proactive people trying to show themselves. It strikes me that it's so easy for typical people to put themselves into a formal text showing excitement and the incredible qualities they have that should be used for the further development of projects, etc. And they generate necessity, or are putting necessity into motion, a very typical motion that involves a kind of presentational portfolio, or I would say subjectived into a single person portfolio, even when they're talking about a community-oriented work or something like that. Basically if you don't show necessity in a typical way it's not a real or actualized necessity for neurotypical eyes, and the ball continues to roll again and again over the bodies that are liminal or thin that cannot fit under an identity. I love the idea of liminal bodies or glorious bodies that come from early christian/pagan philosophy or oikonomia, ghostly entities that have membranes that are so thin that they can be seen erroneously as purely incorporeal. Sometimes I think my body doesn't exist and I feel those kind of email messages or presentational showing only put more weight on a body that's already shattered and tending to the complete disappearance in favour of greedy interests of the truck-machine of typicality. Also I always like to insert the “glorious body” using a different font each time, a font face that would certainly be part of a visual identity you would see in one of those very American delis that here in Montreal are full of smoked meat sandwiches, normally something like a red background and these cursive letters: “glorious body”, or like the one on my new pin of Ronald McDonald that says “welcome”.                 I've been thinking a lot about the bike you gave me. She’s beautiful, no? Also it is not something I didn't know before, but you love me a lot to have been going for months with me by foot to eat nearby, because I discovered I can go to those places in like, 3 minutes, by bike. But also some confuse feelings are affecting my body, like: it’s already mid-September, which means, well, in December there's snow and no biking anymore (at least for me), and then snow, and snow, and snow again, and it's almost time to move again from Canada if nothing happens. Moving to nowhere because there's at least at this moment no future or past but just ghosts of a future that sound really scared. Maybe that's the reason I don't like to stay at home, and that it took me a while to have a bike. Those things are like some kind of root-producing devices (you know I don't believe in the ideas of rooting and etc), but this displacement is so cruel that I don't risk myself to love a house because I know I will suffer when I miss it. Reminds me of some girl that came to talk to me two years ago or so at a party, they were releasing some Deleuzian books. “Well, you know, I'm here now, but I'm moving, always moving, I am a nomad. Bla bla bla”. I felt myself melting at that time, first because it's so easy for neurotypicals to play themselves as “alternative cultures” deleuzian thinkers/artists, when they really never understood anything, being nomadic doesn't mean necessarily physically always moving, or at least not in the traditional sense of travelling, but also going to other existential territories. The movement of the nomad is not extensive but intensive. I think right now in order for me to move I have to be somewhere for a while, for some years. To move with the ghosts that inhabit and flood this body this body needs to be in a place, which I don't see much hope for right
