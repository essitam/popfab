id or not, you know I hate people who dismiss science. And obviously not judge those who want to change themselves, if possible (the research apparently was not funded and ended). But just to think into the world-bodies that are felt as necessary by the typical activists: ‘empathy’ is a necessity, bodies that feel it differently or not feel at all are condemned to judgement in the parliament of Facebook. (Empathy obviously directed to another human subject or very well defined group). Speaking of judgement and condemnations, yesterday during the counting of the votes of the Brazilian elections, I was watching the new Lars von Trier film: The House That Jack Built. Not sure if I liked the film but it has a lot of anarchival qualities. And the epilogue is incredible: the path to hell is through crypts, full of water, a hole opened into the ground, you walk through underworld crypts and voila: you're in hell. You remember that in Riget it's the water leaking into the ground from the previous world of the bleachers that guides the transport of entities from one universe to another. I think both films/series happen in the same universe and there's a network of tunnels where water runs that can guide us to other worlds of the multiverse. We need more crypts. A cryptoverse, maybe (I’m not talking about cryptography or cryptocurrencies but actual crypts) - we have to find the right materials! -, like the Underspazz for example, but more rhizomatic. A world under our world (that's not really ours). If hell and the bleachers’ world, or laundroworld(?) is leaking into this world, I'm already feeling it. Today I moved to downtown for a little more than a week, because my house is falling apart - the underground must be rebuilt. You saw the cracks in my house (look at the picture I've just put) . The workers are going to fix the basement in order to make the building not fallible, they're going to work against the infraworld that is trying to connect with the ground of Montreal. I'm also leaking: I was so anxious that I cut my nails again, too much. Bleeding again. And my new temporary apartment is almost falling apart as well: they're blasting the building in front of mine with dynamite, the street is closed in the direction towards Rue Ste. Catherine so to go to Kazu (which is 60 meters from here) I have to go around the block. Today they performed some blasts and I felt that my whole building trembled. On the other side of the street they're also demolishing! I forgot how this is still possible in Montreal, well, at least only in Downtown. It's so funny because some years ago I did a course of creative writing with a nice Brazilian writer and he said that the most possible genre in places like São Paulo or Shanghai is the chronicle, because the buildings appear and disappear so fast there that entire pieces of old brothels, bars and small buildings simply get out of the realm of existence (at least on the way they used to be) in a few days, and only a chronicle would be able to narrate so quickly the daily life stories of those places. Well, I said it was funny but I didn't say why. Here in Montreal I feel like we're ALWAYS under construction. But also that things stay as they always were. Maybe they're not efficient on construction business here, and who needs efficiency, anyways? But yes, I forgot that downtown has other agreements and laws that allow the construction of big buildings. By the way, the little screenshot I put some pages ago is a comment for the video with the opening soundtrack of Riget: the lyrics!Some sparks from the Dougie Jones’ paper: We would misunderstand not taking position and invisible as ‘not being there’; invisible is 100% there, as Dougie, but different. Invisibility not as an absence but as a point in which it cannot be seen through the bare eyes of neurotypicality (and when invisible creatures can be seen?). Invisibility is a productive device. A neurodiverse body, as all minor bodies, the black body, the migrant body, the native body, is always non-existent: it is not seen, parsed out of experience. It can still be felt, but for this the full feeling of feltverses need to be affirmed in the appetites. appetitive adventure is necessary, and "passage precedes position". “On peut bien décrire les existantes comme <<jetés>> dans le monde, invoquer leur <<être-au-monde>>. Mais comment font ceux qui ne trouvent pas l’entrée qui les fait <<être-au-monde>>? Ils ne s'éprouvent pas commes jetés dans le monde, mais plutôt rejetés au-dehors, expulsés par sa réalité même. Ou bien la part qui est-au-monde ne leur appartient plus, le monde les en a par avance dépossédés” (Lapoujade, 2017, p. 82)         I started sleeping in the living room, to prevent me from sleep walking in the living room and give my feet some rest.Delicious. A cat versus a squirrel in three pictures: (I am so stupid).It is 26 degrees today, in the middle of fall, the warmest it has been ever since they started keeping track of the weather forecast. People are biking in summer dresses and drinking beers outside. Nobody seems to care that this world is upset; nature is confused, this warmth makes the periwinkle and rhododendron in the garden think it’s spring again. Just when they prepared themselves for winter, the warmth came running through their leaves, stirring with all their sense of season. People don’t mind, they just want to make a tour on their boat and have sex with the doors wide open. Ever since we started talking about where vrey would go I haven’t written so much anymore, maybe because suddenly it’s moving I don’t know how to move with it. I guess I just need to compose with the new rhythms.You didn't like my new car? - I love it! Let’s take a ride soon! Vrum vrum You know the picture asking “Is there life after death?” and answering “Here to discuss it are three dead people” ? It’s a beautiful conversation, too bad it’s still all white dead man though, even the death seems to remain typical. On September 2nd around 2 am I asked a friend that exact question to which he said: Didn’t you send me that image already in an email? Then I looked into my inbox and saw I sent it on September 2nd 2017 at 01:17. We were at the same party back then because of our mutual friend’s birthday; apparently that gathering sparks something reappearing! A blanket said in its washing instructions “wash inside out”, I wonder what that means. Somebody told me she’s collaborating with someone she never met before, and now they’re doing something at the same place for the first time, but still they’ll make sure they will never meet. Somebody else told me that often when I’m talking they have no idea what I’m talking about, but then sometimes suddenly they recognize some words I talked about before and by that they understand what I’m saying just for a brief moment. Makes me want to go there where they can hear grass grow. Somebody told me that poetry in order to exist needs to forever not become itself; always chasing itself out of its own form. Unfortunately, most of the forms we encounter are the ones we’re getting to fill out, perhaps even forming our thinking. When poetry happens - and here you can read anything instead of poetry - it’s going to be unrecognizable because then it is not becoming or chasing anymore, and thereby not happening. The novelty is temporality split into what is ceasing to be and what is in process of becoming. It’s always strange but eventually beautiful to notice something like a change of taste; suddenly loving a kind of fruit. It turns taste into a never-ending question, as long as I’m noticing the change, I will forever chase the taste. Let’s drink some chinotto! I love the “Oops!” eraser in the spaz. I don’t like erasers in general, they imply some strange idea of cleaning or perfecting. But this one is different, I don’t think anything has ever been erased with it. It just lurks to look at the iteration of the spaz in a way that it could shift any moment, that it was something that happened but soon will happen in another way. It entails both the oops of making it as the oops of unmaking it. The oops still oopsing into the now. Popping the oops. Oops is totally pop, don’t you think? Also, just to be clear, I think a lot of other thingies have the same kind of quality without needing a word to say it. The frog (before it got kidnapped to Germany) said “OopS!” so often! SpLaSh and OOps and pOp are all very duplicitous. Oops, vrey.When they started building a new building they got rid of the garden. Then as a slow protest she put 500 tulip bulbs in the ground. The director found out they started growing and told all the builders to move the bulbs carefully. “The flowers are wild” she said.  *** Now Playing: Soul Scream - Hitoyono Vacances ***OiI went to the foot doctor to get new techniques for nocturnal sleepings in the living room. She let me walk on blue screens to get inkly prints of the way I walk with the forces of this world. Afterwards she felt my feet and let me invent all kinds of turns and bents and flexes. She said my feet were vrey flexible, no surprise they were so tired from walking , can you imagine all where they went to! In order to deal with the forces pressing, my flexible joints started composing bone-like textures. It’s hard to walk in this world with flexible feet, so no wonder the joints started fabulating, only appearing through blue and bents.When will the ticks finally get their sushi? These boots are made for haunting (ill come back here to write the cab story soon)
