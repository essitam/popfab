I used to have an old red typewriter when I was a child. I think I even learned how to type using it, before I had my first computer. I remember also that I had a phase when I liked to write backwards, typing or handwriting with cursive letters. It's not that I couldn't write in the “right” direction, but one day I woke up and thought it would be more fun to write everything backwards. My teachers got a bit worried because I didn't tell them or my parents that I could still write “normally". This “malfunctioning” is medically or neurologically called something like “mirrored writing”. Also I remember writing a lot of things in the air with my fingers, which used to get me weird looks from classmates and relatives.
