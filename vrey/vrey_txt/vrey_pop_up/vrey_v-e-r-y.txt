Good thing v-r-e-y has 4 different letters. If we made a word out of the whole alphabet it would be 1x2x3x4x5x6x7x8x9x10x11x12x13x14x15x16x17x18x19x20x21x22x23x24x25x26
but if we could reuse letters it would be 4^4.
I was wondering, some of the variations of v-e-r-y even look like names, like YVER. I could imagine giving this name to a child.
