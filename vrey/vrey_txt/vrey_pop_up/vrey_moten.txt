Look at this Fred Moten's passage. I was reading his last book, Stolen Life (2018). What do you think?
“Our actions are not twice behaved and disapparent stand-ins for standing, rather, they are animateriallity out and gone. They are neither the resistance of the object nor the insistence of the thing but something like a kind of negative relay between thingliness and nothingness that is given as an assertion, and in defense, of difference without separation, of consent not to be a single being. Our fate is not to become one and yet many; it is rather, to become a muni bird” (244).
