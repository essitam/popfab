It took me some days to gain some forces to write again, the Brazilian elections ate all my energy, and I couldn’t complete any single task for the past two days. In a certain sense, I knew that it was impossible for me to live there; I am not saying it is never going to happen, but right now, the conditions are not favourable, independently of who wins in the second round. Of course, I don’t want the far-right candidate to win. Still, any result already establishes that a body that cannot sustain itself as the same body for more than two days (or two hours) also cannot stay with all pieces together in a place that requires a constant positioning (in a sense of a subject that has to posit its views in a very clear and, I would say, typical way). I repeated many times that “Dougie Jones doesn’t take position”. Another way to say what I want is: “Dougie Jones doesn’t perform their position according to the signs expected by both the macro and micropolitical eyes”. I imagine that some people would think that Dougie Jones and I are apolitical creatures. The issue is that their view of politics simply cannot understand that bodies are political and that bodies are what they can do; their affordances. Some think that those who experience the world and know how to talk about it are the only ones who can talk about it. If that was the case, this world has already failed. I believe experience is transversal, and we share neurodiversity with everybody in different gradations, nuances, temporalities. Still, people believe in hierarchies of both discursive and bodily enunciations: in moments like this, all the energy must be focused on the “universal” well-being, a universal that is a world-selecting, a world that can fit all kinds of identities but not those who live in the thresholds of where I end, and you begin.
