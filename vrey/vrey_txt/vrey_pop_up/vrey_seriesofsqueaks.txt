I saw that my art school has I’m Very Into You in their library. I’ll go there Monday and get it. I’m still doubting though if I should read it, but I think it’s good if it’s here in my bedroom. Somebody, who I always thought hated my writing, asked me if she could have the text I read last week. Parts of it came out of here, so I put it as a reference, only to find out after I hit send that the autocorrect turned it into I’m Very Into You. Maybe I should still send an email now 5 days later: “I’m so incredibly sorry, but please, you should know it’s VREY. I’m vrey into you. I’m vrey into it. I’m vrey, I am.” Seeing the little red waves dancing underneath all its iterations. What’s nice about giving presentations is that it’s easier to steal words and to weave them like your dreams would, naturally and mischievously, your own and others, well they were never anyone’s to begin with, never personal, always intimate, always repeating. “Language is always ambiguous as to the exact proposition which it indicates. Spoken language is merely a series of squeaks” (Whitehead, 1978: 264). A wet vocabulary, a strange turning point cd-dvd-record shop, a fabulatory portal pore, a lure, a doubling of entering layers, a reading with, a reading of already felt but not yet read,  a there-there spin-out-with-and-and-yes.
