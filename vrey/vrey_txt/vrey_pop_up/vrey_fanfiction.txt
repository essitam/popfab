For me translating is like writing fanfiction, or an anarchival practice. Is this a fanfiction? It would be a really strange kind of fanfiction since you still didn't read the 'original' text. I kinda like this "strangeness", although I have to say the book that activated the title of this book is really good. Do you remember that fanfiction I bought in Drawn and Quarterly, I Love Dick - A fanfiction? I'm looking into it right now, resting and sitting on my table. I don't have a lot of books here.Â Unfortunately the only bobcat I saw was in the Montreal Biodome, a place that I think is kind of horrible, but I went there because the daughter of a friend was eager to visit it. I hope that bobcat escaped from the zoo, finding a nice place to live inside your dreams!
