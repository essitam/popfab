Somebody asked me today: “Oh, aren’t you going tomorrow to the demonstration against the far-right wing candidate in Brazil?”. And I said: “No, it will be full of people”. That reminded me of the time I matched with a girl on Tinder in Brazil. It was a day when there was a huge manifestation against something really bad that I can’t even remember, because there were many things like that. And she said: “Well, I did my part. I went to the manifestation today. Did you do yours?”.I tried to explain her that not all bodies are fit to go to a place full of people who despite the multitude of affects share a common voice, because I would feel panicked and anxious. But it didn’t make any sense to her. “How come, as a man, you didn’t go to the manifestation?” “Well, I’m not a man” “What are you then?” “I have no idea what I am” Obvious that conversation didn’t go anywhere because besides talking in almost two different languages it was also in two different ontologies. Or worlds. That’s why I thought about the necessity of the “FUET memo” that was published in Inflexions 10: Diversity in Diversity. Fabulatory Unit for Emergency Times is needed, also because it vouches for kinds of participation that are neither representative or explicit, simply because those are modulations of putting ourselves into the political world that doesn’t consider the Spinozist conception of what a body can do, or how things cannot endure. Right now, what can I do? I’ll eat some oranges.
