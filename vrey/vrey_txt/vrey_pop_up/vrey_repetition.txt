Spectres of the future are always visiting me. I wake up and they are already there. Sometimes I wonder if that virtuality of the future that decomposes me will really actualize or if there's no future at all without the right conditions… Well, I know time linearity is not a thing, what makes me live the future that will not happen in the future right now, and it's a kind of painful future. I wonder whether with accumulation other movements can appear. Movements that are not necessarily of accumulation but of dispersion. Like the dispersion of textile particles every time I go to the laundromat. Something gets lost, tiny particles of textile disappear by using, reusing, washing, and drying everything many, many times. I know also some things are attached to them by contagiousness and cross-pollination from adventures in the laundromat, or the salt from the sea that penetrates my pores and my swimming clothes. However, most things get thinner, like the sole of my boots. I really like the sensation of touching them and seeing that they're becoming smoother. You may have noticed that I do that often. Repetition, or obsession, as some psychiatrists have said to me. I remember one of them talking to me, saying that if I didn’t resolve the questions of repetitive behaviour I would never get a job. Guess what, I'll never resolve these questions because they're not really questions but just false problems. I really love new obsessions, saying the same words again and again and again. Of course each time it's in a different way but it’s not always easy for everyone to feel that. Maybe repetition bothers some or at least this kind of repetition that is less repetitive or in a less boring way and can’t be put back again into the neurotypical topology and smile like everything is okay and working…
