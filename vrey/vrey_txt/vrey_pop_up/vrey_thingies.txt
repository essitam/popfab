Often I wonder what I will write next time. I can’t imagine of something, but then somehow somewhere I know. It’s tricky though, how to find writing techniques that open up to fabulation? I guess what is very a very important technique is anarchiving. I found this book that my teacher in art school once told me to read. He used to call me the log-lady, carrying something everywhere everytime no matter where no matter when, caring for it and being cared by it. “You don’t really have an art practice, I would call it instead a practice of living, where you just move and sometimes show us blobs of those processes of movements.” Actually I thought of the book again because - do you like thingies? - it has ‘things’ somewhere in the title. It was written in the sixties by a phenomenological psychotherapist about the changeability of things. I hate it but also love some of the passages. It has been very long since I read it though, perhaps I should read it again. What about translating? It is a strange kind of writing practice, don’t you think?
