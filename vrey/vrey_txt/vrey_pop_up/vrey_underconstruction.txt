Today I moved to downtown for a little more than a week, because my house is falling apart - the underground must be rebuilt. You saw the cracks in my house (look at the picture) . The workers are going to fix the basement in order to make the building not fallible, they're going to work against the infraworld that is trying to connect with the ground. I'm also leaking: I was so anxious that I cut my nails again, but I went too far. Bleeding again. And my new temporary apartment is almost falling apart as well: they're blasting the building in front of mine with dynamite, the street is closed in the direction towards Rue Ste. Catherine so to go to my favourite restaurant (which is 60 meters from here) I have to go around the block. Today they performed some blasts and I felt my whole building trembling. On the other side of the street they're also demolishing. It's so funny because some years ago I did a course of creative writing with a writer and he said that the most possible genre in places like SÃ£o Paulo or Shanghai is the chronicle, because the buildings appear and disappear so fast there that entire cafes and houses simply get out of the realm of existence (at least on the way they used to be) in a few days, and only a chronicle would be able to narrate so quickly the daily life stories of those places. Well, I said, it was funny, but I didn't say why. Here I feel like we're ALWAYS under construction. But also that things stay as they were. Maybe they're not efficient in the construction business here, but who needs efficiency, anyways?
