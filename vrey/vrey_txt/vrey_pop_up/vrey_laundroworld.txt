Speaking of judgement and condemnation, yesterday during the counting of votes, I was watching the new Lars von Trier film: The House That Jack Built. Not sure if I liked the film but it has a lot of anarchival qualities. And the epilogue is incredible: the path to hell is through crypts, full of water, a hole opened into the ground, you walk through underworld crypts and voila: you're in hell. You remember that in Riget it's the water leaking into the ground from the previous world of the bleachers that guides the transport of entities from one universe to another. I think both films/series happen in the same universe and there's a network of tunnels where water runs that can guide us to other worlds of the multiverse. We need more crypts. A cryptoverse, maybe (I’m not talking about cryptography or cryptocurrencies but actual crypts) - we have to find the right materials! -, like the Underspazz for example. A world under our world (that's not really ours). If the bleachers’ world, or laundroworld(?) is leaking into this world, I'm already feeling it.
