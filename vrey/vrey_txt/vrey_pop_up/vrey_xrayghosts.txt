I was expecting some anarchival qualities to come with the rolls of film that I brought from Denmark, I've read that the X-ray machines can produce undesirable effects on the pictures. That's everything I ever wanted; to have some ghosts in my images. However, I developed the first film and there was nothing. Only reinforcing my idea that it's hard for those ghosts to appear when there's a very specific and determinate desire about the aesthetical form in which they should present themselves (like when I used to expect to finally be abducted by aliens during my sleep when I was a child). Well, I've also read that it affects only film with sensitivities higher than 800 ISO and the X-ray in the checked luggage is way stronger, which made my will almost impossible with the Snappy camera that accepts only 400 ISO // spoiler: I bought a new camera on eBay and it's really weird but still didn't arrive // Maybe I should put those cameras inside an MRI machine, which is one of the first scenes of Riget (I love watching this tv-show again). But also I figured that the ghosts are there in other forms which were not detectable by our figurative way of looking into pictures. We should attend more to the minimal beings that are hardly visible with just the sense of sight. Maybe we need more haptic ghosts.
