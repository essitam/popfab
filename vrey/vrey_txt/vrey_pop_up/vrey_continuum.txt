I read frictionous instead of flirtatious during the first time (and that word doesn't even exist), but I think it's part of the soft-skinned conjunction to be frictionous, or frictional, what the orthography corrector says is the “right word”. Cats can be very frictionous no? Or raccoons… I guess that’s the reason we don't put our names on the paragraphs, because it's a lot of people writing, and soon I won't know which version of me or you wrote which thing. I guess we already don't know that, especially because it's not needed to know and to point out.
