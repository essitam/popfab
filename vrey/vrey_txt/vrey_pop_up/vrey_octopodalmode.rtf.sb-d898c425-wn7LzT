\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 I think I would prefer the octopodal mode of thinking through different tentacles that have their own desires, the lures that activate them... But I don't really think that cats cannot do that, or humans - or more-than humans (especially). The event knows itself to the order of what the event wants, and I think a good and non-translatable encounter like ours happens when the creatures that compose the event-eventing are involved in some tendencies that can have different modulations but still can, in a way, interact and input contagiousness, generating a kind of movement that is a bit non-coordinated but that carries a strange beauty. I talk about all the versions of me that exceed my body talking to all the versions of you (well, maybe not all of them, I'm sure some versions of me may not like that, but they are infinite...or at least I think they tend to infinity.) }
