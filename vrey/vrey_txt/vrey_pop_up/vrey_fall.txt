It is 26 degrees today, in the middle of fall, the warmest it has been ever since they started keeping track of the weather forecast. People are biking in summer dresses and drinking beers outside. Nobody seems to care that this world is upset; nature is confused, this warmth makes the periwinkle and rhododendron in the garden think it’s spring again. Just when they prepared themselves for winter, the warmth comes running through their leaves, stirring with all their sense of season. People don’t mind, they just want to make a tour on their boat and have sex with the doors wide open. Ever since we started talking about where these texts would go I haven’t written so much anymore, maybe because suddenly it’s moving I don’t know how to move with it. Time to compose with the new rhythms.
