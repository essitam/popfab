“I couldn’t believe that you can’t just stand up and walk out of it. You can’t even go in the train or car and you have to go for hours and you’re still inside the city. And this completely freaked me out, I was so claustrophobic, and I was so obsessed with oxygen; I couldn’t breath. I was trying to touch the buildings and scrape of the grease and try to get in touch with things. It was very scary. But then I learned to relax all about it and I found it kind of kinky.” (Björk interview I found somewhere on the internet)
