By the way, I just developed the last film of the Snappy period. Of course I will use the camera again, but I want to try my new weird Olympus LT-1. I love the first picture of the roll where there’s always something missing (but in that sense also something adding). This is the room they rented for me when I was in Århus. The kid that lives there is called Alice, well, at least I think so… her name was on the door, some Lego-like letters attached to it, forming the name A-L-I-C-E, but then I accidentally broke the letter I. Now it's just A-L-C-E. It would be nice if they adopted this new name for her. It's “reindeer” in Portuguese!
