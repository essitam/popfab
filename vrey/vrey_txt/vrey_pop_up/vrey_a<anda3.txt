Every day I’m so excited to write but then when the time comes to write im simply exhausted from all expectations like having a clean body and clean house and being on time and responding to emails. The only possible way of responding for me is to disappear, but since I still don’t know all the techniques of that practice the closest thing I can think of is to fall asleep. I opened The Lure of the Ghost again and it said “Welcome back!” It’s vrey yrev good to see you again, old friend. This morning I slept in late and read a nice text in bed with a coffee. I had so much energy and beautiful words floating in my head, but then I had to go to the university. Now I’m back home and exhausted. All the words got sucked out of me. My stomach and skin have been so upset this week, first signs to sleep water and drink water to float away. Blurry words and images caused by your blurry view can be beautiful though, a bit like ghosts. Filenames deliberately misspelled, passed on through the internet as lures. Writing against memory and forgetting at the same time. Editing lure and jumping from page 60 to 82, because the end of the first page and the beginning of the last page looked exactly the same when I squeezed my eyes. Writing before your addition and after your addition from this afternoon at the same time. I miss flirting with you. Now I can only flirt with the ghost of you here (hoping the ghost of me there also does some flirting) and with boring digital words. Sending you one more compilation of a ‘<’ and a ‘3’ is going to make me cry. < and 3 always implies a less than 3. But it’s always so much more than that! At least the ghosts make up for that, they know a lot about such things. Still, “I like you” makes me very glad to say to you, but also makes me just want to sit next to you and say nothing, maybe just cough once.
