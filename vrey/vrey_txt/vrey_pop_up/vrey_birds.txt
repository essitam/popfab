I went to my old art school because it’s one of the few places here that has a copy of I’m Very Into You. I also went there to have a coffee with an old lover, but as soon as I smelled his smell I understood I didn’t love him anymore. It was a bit painful because in the way he encountered me I could tell how much he cared about me. He said as I was looking out of the window that my eyes always look as if I’m drowning in my thoughts. I said, oh yes, I drown all the time, to which he said I imagine your head as if it’s Atlantis. He said he had seen something that one of my closest friends had been up to: in a little tower in the park weaving the sounds of birds. The person from the library was nice though, he let me take the books even though they misspelled my last name. Reading the preface before I got onto my bike made me sad. They talk about a seduction, not about a love. It made me think whether this is for you also a temporary seduction instead of creating conditions, sharing sensitivities and having love for all variations of each other. I had to think about my dream again in which you told me you never wanted to see me to which my pores replied by clogging until I died. I stopped halfway on the bike because I wanted to write all of this down, but I parked my bike somewhere where they were doing the piping so it smelled like poop and I moved to further down the street where the park begins with the little tower and the loom and the birds.
