My early childhood coincided with the release of the first season of The X-Files broadcasted on television. If I remember correctly it was released on Brazilian free television almost at the same time it aired in the US, which was uncommon. Cable TV was still not very popular there. But anyways, when I started to watch The X-Files as a little child, I became fascinated with the idea of the abduction by external forces that were either extraterrestrial or cryptozoological - well, yes, there were some episodes that tended to more spiritualized cases but they were not my preferred ones. Every night I wished to be abducted by one of those creatures and be tested, examined, etc. But when I realized that some creatures or ghosts are very human I understood that I wouldn't like those so much. Well, I guess there are all kinds of specks of ghosts and extraterrestrial beings. Including the ghosts of trauma and repulse to neurodiversity that inhabit São Paulo. I guess that's why the only way I go back to Brazil is for visiting parents and cats. Also it makes me feel really sad that conspiracy theory right now is so oriented to the right-wing, my whole infancy was built with fabulating with The X-Files, Twin Peaks and other TV shows with all sorts of conspiracy theories, which made me survive, believing and creating a world.
