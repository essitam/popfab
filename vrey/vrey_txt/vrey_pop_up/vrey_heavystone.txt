I found the heaviest material in this world. It is as big as a grain of sand, but is as heavy as a stone you’d normally carry with two hands. It’s laying in the palm of my hand. It would’ve fit on my fingertip but my finger simply bends too heavily when I tried to hold it there. Carrying in my closed hand works, and then just opening it when I show it to anyone around me. I have to bend my arm a bit, you can see my muscles flexing when I lower my hand and open the fingers. When I got back home I put it on a stack of fabrics. It’s so beautiful to see such a small grain makes such an impact, drawing the fabrics to the blue painted wooden floor.
